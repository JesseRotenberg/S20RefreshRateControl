# S20RefreshRateControl

XDA Page - https://labs.xda-developers.com/store/app/sszb.s20.refresh

Simple app to change S20/S20+/S20 Ultra Refresh rate (96HZ/120HZ) without ADB. Thanks to Max Weinbach for finding this tweak and Rohit Shetty for testing this app.

This app also includes 2 qs tiles for setting 96hz and 120hz. Check in your quick settings panel to add them.

If you like this app, try #hex installer for theming your S20. Available on Play Store.

Info: This app targets older android sdk in order to set refresh rates without ADB requirement. Ignore the dialog that says "This app was built for an older version of Android...."
